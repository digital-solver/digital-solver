ðŸ¤– Hey, I'm Kerr, the @digital-solver. At heart I'm a 'Solver': an entrepreneurial technologist, inventor, futurist, artificer, and innovator. I am driven by a passion for technology and business and a desire to explore the limitless potential of advanced technologies.

ðŸš€ With a strong background in tech startups and a deep fascination with the intersection of technology and business, I am constantly seeking out innovative ways to drive growth and value. My research into the potential for AI to be musically creative sparked a deeper interest in the business applications of advanced technologies. I have since dedicated myself to seeking out or building innovative and advanced solutions that address real-world problems and produce widespread value.

ðŸŒ± As a JavaScript developer with experience in the MERN and MEAN stacks, I am always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of software development and leverage emerging technologies. I am also committed to staying at or beyond the cutting edge, and am actively studying Python for AI and Rust for performance to further enhance my skills.

ðŸŽ¸ When not dreaming up new tech businesses, you'll find me exploring the interaction of music and technology, whether through improvising on an electric guitar, composing new pieces, or writing algorithms to generate original compositions. Music is a true passion for me, and I enjoy finding ways to incorporate it into my other interests.

ðŸ“« If you're interested in discussing tech entrepreneurship, the business applications of technology, or anything else, don't hesitate to reach out to me at kerr(dot)digitalsolver@gmail.com. I'm always eager to engage in thought-provoking conversations about the impact of technology on the future and how we can harness its power to create a better world. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
