ðŸ¤– Hey, I'm Kerr, the @digital-solver. At heart I'm a 'Solver': an entrepreneurial technologist, inventor, futurist, and innovator, with a passion for technology and business. I have a particular interest in advanced tech and how it can be used to create value and new solutions.

ðŸš€ With a strong background in tech startups and a deep passion for technology, I'm constantly seeking out innovative ways to merge my interests and drive value and growth. My initial curiosity for AI's potential for creativity in music led me to delve into the topic in my university dissertation. This curiosity has since evolved into a deeper interest in exploring the business applications of advanced technologies and finding innovative ways to use them to address problems and create value.

ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm using and building my MERN/MEAN skills to create full-stack web applications. I'm also always exploring new technologies to see how they can be leveraged for business purposes. On the horizon, I see myself studying Python for AI, Rust for performance, and using AI tools to increase my productivity and speed as a developer.

ðŸŽ¸ When I'm not coding, you'll find me plucking away on my guitar, composing a new piece, or writing a composition algorithm. Music is a big part of my life and I love finding ways to incorporate it into my work and passions.

ðŸ“« If you want to chat about tech entrepreneurship, the business applications of technology, or anything else, feel free to reach out to me at kerr(dot)digitalsolver@gmail.com! I'm always up for a good deep conversation about the implications of technology on the future. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
